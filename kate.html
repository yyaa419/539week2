      <p>
        Phuket province is located in southern Thailand. It is the biggest
        Island of Thailand and sits on the Andaman sea. The nearest province to
        the north is Phang-nga and the nearest provinces to the east are
        Phang-nga and Krabi. Phuket has a large Chinese influence, so you will
        see many Chinese shrines and Chinese Restaurants around the City. A
        Chinese Vegetarian Festival is held there every year. While the Chinese
        community is quite big, there are many other ethnicities bringing all
        their traditions and festivals from all over the world to Phuket.
